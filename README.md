# Fine-Print-PDF-Scanner
The fine print pdf scanner i made uses chatgpt api and streamlit to be able to upload pdfs a nd have chatgpt analize it for concering things (ex selling data) then it shows u a clean response using streamlit. it also has a score bar (higher score, higher concern)

I used PYPDF for converting uploaded PDFs to text. 
Then with that text i used chatgpt api 4.0mini to analyse it for fine print. This includes things like selling data Opt out days.
i created this project because i felt too many companies were getting away with advertising things that look like good deals. but in the end they would be basically legally scamming you. 
I also included sample pdfs that were pre analysed by this ai on discords TOS and Apples Purchase Agreement. 
This mainly runs on streamlit, as it was easy to setup and looked good and ran fast.
This took around 3 hours to make as i had some issues at the start.
